# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

I don't think I understand the question. State can't be created or updated or undone in a functional component? Or if 'stateful' is a way of saying 'class-based,' then I know one difference between them is that you can't use hooks in class-based components to get around the component hierarchy.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

A componentWillMount function can be called before the component renders.

3. Define stateful logic.

My understanding is that it refers to logic that either creates, updates, or desolates state in a component.

4. What are the three steps of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

Arrange, Act, Assert.

Arrange: Line the component up in the test's sights.
Act: Declare the specific target(s) (eg, 'constant(s)')
Assert: Fire your accusation at the target(s) (eg, 'x')
